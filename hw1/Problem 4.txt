If we modify the Vigenere encipherment to use a single key that is at least as long as the message. It will be more secure since there is no repeating pattern. The attacker cannot use the frequency analysis to decrypt the key. Also, if we can make sure the key is randomly chose and never be used a second time, the cipher might be more secure, because, in this case, the key is an OTP.
